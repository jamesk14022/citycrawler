## Citycrawler 🍺

Web app that uses graph theory to generate custom “city crawl” routes in EU and US cities. This was built mostly as as a Golang and graph theory learning exercise. These walking routes encourage you to explore the finest drinking establishments in a city. Some features:

- A scraped "pub directory" containing 50,000+ relevant pubs from major cities
- Customizable Routes: Users can generate routes with adjustable lengths and select the number of bars included. They can also choose to include cultural areas of interest in their route.

### Run
